## Situation:
As the lead of a team of four during my 4th year machine learning course, I successfully developed a loan defaulter prediction model using the Lending Club Loan Dataset. 
Developed a machine learning model for loan defaulter prediction using the
###### Lending Club Loan Dataset
from Kaggle. The dataset consisted loan data from 2007-2015, including loan status and payment information.

## Task: 
Divided the project into two parts, namely Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Cleaning, and Training a machine learning model.

## Actions:

### EDA and Data Cleaning:
1.Conducted relevant feature selection to focus on important variables.

2.Performed null value imputation to handle missing data.

3.Created dummy variables for categorical features to convert them into numerical representation.

4.Handled outliers to ensure robust model performance.

5.Checked for multicollinearity among features to avoid redundant information.


### Model Training:
1.Utilized Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and LightGBM algorithms for training the machine learning model.

2.Applied suitable hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation techniques to optimize model performance.

3.Evaluated and compared the models based on their predictive accuracy.


## Results:

Achieved a loan defaulter prediction accuracy of 61% using the developed machine learning model.
Improved Return on Investment (ROI) of loans by effectively identifying potential defaulters.
By effectively performing EDA, data cleaning, and employing different machine learning algorithms, successfully developed a predictive model for loan defaulters. This resulted in enhanced accuracy and ROI, making it a valuable asset for risk assessment in lending operations.
